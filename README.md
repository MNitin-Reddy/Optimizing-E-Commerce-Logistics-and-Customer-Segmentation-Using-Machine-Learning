## **Project Overview**
In the fast-paced e-commerce industry, timely deliveries and effective customer engagement are crucial. However, frequent delivery delays and inefficient customer segmentation can lead to poor customer satisfaction and financial losses. This project leverages machine learning techniques to:
- Predict delivery delays and cancellations.
- Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## **Problem Statement**
E-commerce businesses face challenges such as:
- Late deliveries due to unpredictable supply chain inefficiencies.
- Increased cancellations and customer dissatisfaction.
- Generic marketing strategies failing to address diverse customer needs.

## **How AI Helps**
Machine learning can:
- Predict delivery outcomes using historical order data, enabling proactive logistics management.
- Cluster customers based on purchasing patterns, allowing businesses to offer targeted promotions and loyalty programs.

## **Objective**
1. **Classification Task:** Predict delivery delays and cancellations to enhance logistics planning and customer satisfaction.
2. **Clustering Task:** Segment customers to tailor marketing campaigns and optimize business strategies.

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset consists of e-commerce transactions, including features such as:
- **Order Details:** Order ID, date, delivery status, shipping type.
- **Customer Information:** Region, city, segment.
- **Transaction Details:** Sales amount, discount, profit, order quantity.
- **Shipping Data:** Scheduled vs. real shipping time.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Key insights:
- **54.8% of orders are delayed**, highlighting a logistics issue.
- **Outliers detected** in sales, discounts, and profits, requiring scaling.
- **First-class shipping has the highest delays**, making it unreliable.
- **Late deliveries impact customer retention**, with order numbers declining over time.

## **Feature Engineering**
- **Removed irrelevant columns** like customer names and order IDs.
- **Converted date columns** into numeric features (year, month).
- **Checked multicollinearity** and dropped redundant variables.
- **Performed chi-square tests** to retain only significant categorical features.

## **Model Development**
### **Classification (Delivery Delay Prediction):**
- **Models Used:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Best Model:** Random Forest with an accuracy of **XX%**.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** improved precision and recall.

### **Clustering (Customer Segmentation):**
- **Techniques Used:** K-Means, DBSCAN.
- **Optimal Clusters:** X clusters found, representing distinct customer behaviors.

## **Results and Insights**
- **Random Forest outperformed other classifiers**, achieving the best balance between precision and recall.
- **Key factors influencing delivery delays** include shipping type, region, and order quantity.
- **Customer segmentation helped differentiate high-value vs. discount-driven buyers.**

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how AI can optimize e-commerce operations by improving logistics and personalizing customer engagement. Future enhancements include:
- Integrating real-time order tracking data.
- Experimenting with deep learning for better predictions.
- Refining customer segmentation using additional behavioral attributes.
